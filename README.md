# Creating interactive graphs using the D3 library

## The project 

The purpose of the project was to learn a new JavaScript library : [D3](https://d3js.org/). To go on with that, I had to create graphs to illustrate data which was given.

You can see the project [here](http://terencehecq.github.io/js-datavisualisation-challenge/) ! 


## What I learned 

- Create graphs with d3 (*Thank's Captain Obvious*)
- Get data from HTML table
- Properties of SVG and specific SVG elements
- Get the right data on hover (a bit tricky)
- Generate complete DOM elements from d3 and data (Dropdowns)

- Understand someone else's code to help with (Not specific to d3)


## Encountered challenges 

#### Graphs 1 & 2 :

- **Formatting data** from HTML tables
- Interactivity on **hover**
- Generate **dropdowns** from data

#### Graph 3

- Use **setInterval()** function at the right place
- Centered axis with **negative values**
- **Transitions** on rectangles


## Personal debrief 

D3 is quite simple **IF** the data is formatted in a right way. 

There are several tuto's on the web but I had to pay attention to the vesion of d3. I was working with *d3.v5* while a lot of tuto's are still in v3 or v4 where syntax was different.
